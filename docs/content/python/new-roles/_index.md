Roles for SQLAlchemy Early Access
=================================

We're working on the next major version of support for roles in Oso. Our
first release is in the SQLAlchemy library. This library makes it easy
to model role based access control in Polar and enforce it over your
SQLAlchemy models. If you're interested in using Roles with other
languages or frameworks, let us know in our [Slack](https://join-slack.osohq.com/).

The library is now available for early access. Our team continues to
iterate on it and is excited to hear your feedback.

The SQLAlchemy roles library is accompanied by [GitClub](https://github.com/osohq/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react), our best
practice example app for using Oso with SQLAlchemy.

This section of the documentation contains guides and reference for
using the new SQLAlchemy library. If you'd like to use the currently
released version [see here](/reference/frameworks/sqlalchemy).
