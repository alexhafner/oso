# Demo

# Demo format

# one python file

# multiple levels of functionality
# 1. Built-in org roles (no customization)--basically equivalent to "global roles" in a multi-tenant app
#       - Owner, member, billing
#       - give some permissions
#       - show allow queries
# 2. Same-level implied roles
#       - show having "Owner" implies "Member" and "Billing"
# 3. Relationships + child permissions
#       - Add org-repo relationships
#       - Create repo permissions
#       - Add repo permissions to org
# 4. Add repo roles (different resources can have their own roles)
#       - Admin, Write, Read
#       - set these up as implied roles
#       - give some permissions
#       - show allow queries
#       - **we'll have to show how you take permissions off the org and switch over to implied roles**
# 5. Base repo permissions within an org (Implied roles across resource types based on relationships)
#       - Set up Org member base permissions for repos in org
#       - Org admin base permissions for repos in org
# 6. Customize the Org member role per organization
#       - Toggle for whether members can create private repos
#       - Create new permission
#       - Add scoped permission to member role for an org

# HAVEN'T IMPLEMENTED:

# 7. Customize base repo role for org members per organization
#       - Add scoped implication to the member role for an org
#       - scoped implication is only scoped to the parent (org) not the child (repo)
# 8. Customize base repo role for org members per repo
#       - Add scoped implication to the member role for a repo
#       - scoped implication is scoped to the child (repo)
